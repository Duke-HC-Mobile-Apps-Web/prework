# Prework

##Overview
The goal with this prework is to make sure everyone is comfortable with concepts such as git and bash before the first day of class.  **Please complete by 1/20.**

###No Mac?

All of this may be done without a Mac using a Linux installation.  A good option is installing Ubuntu via virtualbox (<http://virtualbox.org>).  Just click the new button and follow prompts for creating an Ubuntu virtual machine.  

##Work

###Bash

Bash is a text-based shell for controlling your computer.  On Mac and Ubuntu it is accessed via the Terminal application.

**(10 min)** - Complete the bash tutorial at <https://github.com/learn-co-students/bash-tutorial-001-prework-web/blob/master/README.md>

**(20 min)** - Watch the following video to explore more command line basics:

###Git

Understanding git is critical in this class, as we'll be using it to keep everyone up to date with the class codebase and to allow assignments to be sent back to us.

**(5 min)** - Read about the central ideas behind git.

**(~40 min)** - Learn some basic git commands by completing the intro to git assignment found here:
<https://github.com/Duke-HC-Mobile-Apps-Web/Git-Intro/blob/master/README.md>

###JavaScript

Take the [Codecademy JavaScript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript).  You may skip any concepts you are familiar with.  If this is taking you more than several hours, it's not critical to finish by the first week of class.

###Additional
Feeling bored? Dive into 'The Basics' section of [The Swift Programming Language](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/).  This is also available as an iBook with the same title.
